GENERAL

This is an API for retrieving the twitter feed of a user (in the current implementation, that is myself). The data is presented in key-value pairs, where one key is "text", meaning the actual text of the tweet, and the other key is "image description", which is the Google Vision description of any image associated with the tweet.
